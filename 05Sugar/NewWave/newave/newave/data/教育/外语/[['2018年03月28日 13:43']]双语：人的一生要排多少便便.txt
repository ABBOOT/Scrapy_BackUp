　　人一生中要排多少便便？美国趣味科学网站近日给出了答案。该网站称，人们便便的数量可能根据年龄、体重、饮食、运动和其他因素会有很大差异。
　　A person's accomplishments accumulate over years and decades. Something else accumulates, too — their poop.
　　人们所获得的成就经年累月地积累，还有其他一些东西的总量也在不断累加——他们的便便。
　　The quantities of poop that people leave behind during an individual bathroom break can vary widely, depending on age, body weight, diet, exercise and other factors.
　　人们排出体外的便便数量可能会因年龄、体重、饮食、运动及其他因素的不同有很大差异。
　　But how much poop does the average person produce in their lifetime?
　　那么，一般来说人们一生中会排出多少便便呢？
　　Moving one's bowels is part of the normal digestive process for most animals; after nutrients are extracted from food and liquid, waste is eliminated as urine and feces.
　　排便是大多数动物正常消化过程中的一部分；人们从食物和液体中摄取营养物质后将废物作为尿液和便便排出。
　　Human stool, when healthy, is usually made up of about 70-percent solids and 30-percent fluids, Kim Barrett, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, told Live Science. Personal bowel habits notwithstanding, on average, both men and women move their bowels about once per day and produce a daily average of 400 to 500 grams of feces, Barrett said.
　　加利福尼亚大学圣迭戈分校医学教授金•巴雷特对趣味科学网站记者说，健康的人类便便通常由70%的固体和30%的流体组成。巴雷特说，尽管个人的排便习惯不同，但男性和女性平均每天排便一次，排泄量平均约为400-500克。
　　Researchers have even identified the speed at which humans generally produce their poo: about 2 centimeters per second, Live Science previously reported. Constipation — being unable to move one's bowels — can lead to longer, or more uncomfortable bathroom sessions. However, the amount of time a person typically dedicates to unobstructed defecation is about 12 seconds per stool, and is uniform across many animal species regardless of their size, according to David Hu, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Patricia Yang, a Georgia Tech doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering.
　　根据趣味科学网站此前的报道，研究人员甚至确定了人类排便的平均速度：大约每秒2厘米。便秘（难以排便）可能令人们在卫生间待的时间更长、更不舒服。然而，佐治亚理工学院机械工程和生物系副教授戴维•胡和机械工程学博士研究生帕特里夏•杨认为，每个人每次顺畅排便的时间大约是12秒，而且许多动物物种都是如此，无论其体型大小。
　　Starting with an average daily amount of about 400 grams, the total poop production in a week's time would be about 2.8 kilograms. In a year, a single person would yield about 145 kg of poop — just a little more than an adult panda weighs.
　　从平均每天排便约400克开始计算，一周的排便量约为2.8公斤。一年间，一个人的排便量将达到大约145公斤——比一只成年熊猫的体重略多一点。
　　In the US, the average life expectancy for men is about 76 years old, and for women, it is around 81 years old. Therefore, a man living to age 76 would produce about 11,030 kg of poop over his lifetime, and a woman living to age 81 would produce about 11,757 kg — so a lifetime of a woman's poop weighs about as much as three adult male hippos.
　　在美国，男性的平均预期寿命约为76岁，而女性的平均预期寿命约为81岁。因此，一个活到76岁的男子一生将产生大约11030公斤便便。一个活到81岁的女人一生会产生大约11757公斤的便便——相当于三只成年雄性河马的重量。
　　Recently, the stark reality of how much poop humans can produce prompted action from officials at Denali National Park and Reserve in Alaska. Years of unregulated pooping by visitors to Denali, North America's tallest mountain, left an estimated 69,000 to 98,000 kg of feces deposited on the mountain between 1951 and 2012.
　　最近，人们便便总量的残酷事实促使阿拉斯加州德纳里国家公园和保护区的负责人们采取了行动。德纳里峰是北美最高的山峰。据估计在1951年到2012年间，到访德纳里峰的游客在山中随地排便达6.9万至9.8万公斤。
　　Another unpleasant reality is that 4.5 billion people around the world do not have access to household toilets that safely dispose of their waste, according to the United Nations. And each year, over 181 million metric tons of human waste goes untreated, with more than 90 percent of sewage in the developing world released directly into oceans, lakes and rivers.
　　另一个让人不悦的事实是，据联合国的数据，全球45亿人家中没有洗手间，无法安全处理排泄问题。每年，未经处理的人类排泄物达1.81亿公吨。发展中国家超过90%的排泄物直接排入海洋、河流和湖泊。
　　At least 1.8 billion people worldwide depend on a drinking water source that is contaminated by fecal residue; poor sanitation leads to disease outbreaks and public health crises that affect millions of people each year — many of them children. However, improving access to clean water and implementing better sanitation practices could prevent approximately 842,000 deaths each year, according to reports from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund.
　　全球至少有18亿人的饮用水受到便便残渣污染。糟糕的卫生状况导致疾病爆发和公共健康危机，每年有数百万人受到影响，其中很多是儿童。但根据世界卫生组织和联合国儿童基金会的报告，让更多人喝到清洁水以及贯彻执行更好的卫生行为每年可以防止大约84.2万人死亡。
